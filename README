Just source the ./etc/environment file in your .bashrc with something like this.

  if [ -f ~/Repos/aws/etc/environment ]; then source ~/Repos/aws/etc/environment; fi


You can also now have multiple checkouts of this codebase. If you source a different environment it will set you up for a different aws account.


These are the aliases that I use to swithc between my different codebases.

  alias aws-environment="echo \$EC2_CERT | grep -o 'aws-[a-z]*' | sed 's/aws-//'"
  alias aws-production="source ~/Repos/aws-production/etc/environment"
  alias aws-testing="source ~/Repos/aws-testing/etc/environment"
