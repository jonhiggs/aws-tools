Just source the ./etc/environment file in your .bashrc with something like this.

  if [ -f ~/Repos/aws/etc/environment ]; then source ~/Repos/aws/etc/environment; fi


You can also now have multiple checkouts of this codebase. If you source a different environment it will set you up for a different aws account.
